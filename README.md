# Unhandled Exceptions in Dart JSON Processing

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications involving asynchronous operations and JSON processing. The `fetchData` function makes an HTTP request, but its error handling is incomplete.  It only catches exceptions during the HTTP request itself, not those that might occur during JSON decoding or access of specific fields within the JSON data.  This can lead to unexpected crashes and runtime errors.

The solution shows how to improve error handling to catch these additional potential issues, using type checking and more robust error handling for a more resilient application.
